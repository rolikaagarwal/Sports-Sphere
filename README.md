## What I learned- 

- Creating APIs: I learned how to develop APIs, which are endpoints that handle requests and provide data or perform actions for my website.

- Integrating APIs in Frontend: I gained the ability to connect my frontend code with the APIs I created. This allowed me to fetch data from the backend and update my website's user interface accordingly.

- User Authentication with JWT Tokens: I implemented user authentication using JWT tokens, which helped secure my website. This involved managing user registration, login, and logout processes, as well as generating and validating tokens for authorized access.
